researchInfo0=Income +2,5    Baltic +0 \n\nWheat is a traditional spring time grain. Preparation of soil is done during the spring when erosion of the soil occurs the least. 
researchInfo1=Income +2,5    Baltic +1\nRequirements: wheat \n\nRoots of the oat reach deep into the soil. Oat cultivates the soil and produces valuable organic matter.
researchInfo2=Income +4    Baltic +1 \nRequirements: oat \n\nCaraway is a perennial  plant. Caraway slows down the erosion of the soil and nutrient leaching by utilizing nutrients efficiently and being a small-scale consumer of nitrogen.
researchInfo3=Income +5    Baltic +0 \nRequirements: caraway, \n                               3 workers\n\nStrawberry is a perennial accessory fruit, which demands a lot of nitrogen. It has a high risk of disease and requires a 4-year break from a specific field section.
researchInfo4=Income +4    Baltic +0 \n\nTractor makes cultivation more efficient.
researchInfo5=Income +4    Baltic +0 \nRequirements: tractor, \n                            composted manure,\n                            3 workers\n\nExcavator is used to turn compost. Turning it speeds up combustion and improves its quality.
researchInfo6=Income +3    Baltic +1 \nRequirements: 2 workers\n\nOwning livestock makes the use of manure more accessible. Having livestock adds grass cultivation to your field circulation.
researchInfo7=Income +4    Baltic +1 \nRequirements: livestock, \n                               2 workers\n\nManure is an organic fertilizer that has a rich and balanced nutrient concentration. It increases organic matter in the soil.
researchInfo8=Income +3    Baltic +1 \nRequirements: manure, \n                               2 workers\n\nComposted manure absorbs nutrients to the soil more efficiently, which prevents nutrient leaching.
researchInfo9=Income +3    Baltic +2 \nRequirements: oat, 2 workers\n\nIn field circulation fields are separated into sections. They are cultivated with different plants in different seasons. It helps to maintain nutrient balance and stops diseases and pests.
researchInfo10=Income +0    Baltic +2 \nRequirements: field circulation, \n                               2 workers\n\nBuffer strips decrease nutrient leaching by absorbing nutrients. The strip can be cultivated with grass between the field and areas of water.
researchInfo11=Income +5    Baltic +0 \nRequirements: buffer strip, \n                               2 workers\n\nIn addition to the benefits of the buffer strip, a flower strip attracts beneficial insects like pollinators, which affects the production of the crops.
researchInfo12=Income +5    Baltic +0 \nRequirements: buffer strip, \n                               3 workers\n\nBeehives improve the yields due to more efficient pollinating.
researchInfo13=Income +3    Baltic +1 \nRequirements: buffer strip, \n                               2 workers\n\n4-year grass gives more time for the soil to recover. During the time biodiversity of the soil improves.
researchInfo14=Income +0    Baltic +2 \nRequirements: 4y grass, \n                               2 workers\n\n5-meter buffer strip absorbs nutrients and prevents nutrient leaching better.
researchInfo15=Income +3    Baltic +3 \nRequirements: 4y grass, \n                               2 workers\n\nEnvironmental fallows increase diversity in plant species and animals.
researchInfo16=Income +6    Baltic +4 \nRequirements: 5m buffer strip, \n                               4 workers\n\nOrganic production is an ecological way to cultivate without chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides.
researchInfo17=Income +5    Baltic +3 \nRequirements: environmental \n                               fallow, 4 workers\n\nGame fallow is sown mostly during autumn after the actual crops. Game fallow crops grow roots that absorb the nutrients protecting them from leaching. The field is used to attract game.
researchInfo18=Income +5    Baltic +3 \nRequirements: environmental \n                               fallow, 4 workers\n\nWetlands slow down the water flows causing nutrients and soil to settle to the bottom of the wetland. Wetland can absorb even 90% of the soil and nutrients flowing through.
